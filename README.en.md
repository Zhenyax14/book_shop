## 🏗 System Architecture
## 🧱 Project Architecture

The project follows a modern architecture based on:

- **Backend API**: Laravel

Public Frontend: Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Administration Panel: Client Side Rendering (CSR) with Vue.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Containers: Docker

Simplified structure:

bookshop/
│
├── book-store-backend
├── book-store-frontend
├── book-store-docker
├── docs
└── README.md
⚙️ Rendering Strategy

The platform uses a hybrid rendering architecture to optimize SEO, performance, and interactivity.

Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Used in the public part of the platform:

Book catalog

Book detail pages

Landing pages

Indexable content

Advantages:

Better SEO

Faster initial rendering

Better search engine indexing

Client Side Rendering (CSR)

Used in:

Administration panel

Interactive book reader

Examples:

Book management (CRUD)

Catalog management

System administration

Advantages:

SPA-like experience

Faster interactions

Reduced page reloads

Does not require strong SEO optimization
